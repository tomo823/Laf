  "text": "I've lost my faith in this broken system I've got love for my home But if you cry, is there anyone listening? We're the forgotten generation We want to have a conversation Follow me on this road You know we gotta let go For all of the times that they say it's impossible They build the hurdles, the wars and the obstacles When we're together you know we're unstoppable now I'm not afraid to tear it down and build it up again It's not our fate, we could be the renegades I'm here for you, are you here for me too? Let's start again, we could be the renegades They've been holding us down They've been telling us to change our voices But we're not part of the crowd We better bet and we're making wrong choices We may be underestimated But I don't wonder we will make it Time to say out loud We're young and we're proud \u9023\u308c\u8fbc\u307e\u308c\u5857\u308a\u91cd\u306d\u3089\u308c\u305f \u5618\u306f\u50d5\u3089\u3092\u98f2\u307f\u8fbc\u3093\u3060 We gotta fight for our rights after things fill up now I'm not afraid to tear it down and build it up again It's not our fate, we could be the renegades I'm here for you, are you here for me too? Let's start again, we could be the renegades Take a deep breath, close your eyes and get ready Take a deep breath, close your eyes and get ready Take a deep breath, close your eyes and get ready to fly I'm not afraid to tear it down and build it up again It's not our fate, we could be the renegades I'm here for you, are you here for me too? Let's start again, we could be the renegades We could be the renegades"
